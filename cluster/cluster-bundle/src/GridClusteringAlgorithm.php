 * Grid-based clustering algorithm for spatial data.
 *
 * This algorithm groups points into fixed-size grid cells based on the given zoom level.
 *
 * Best for:
 * - Fast, scalable clustering on large geographical datasets
 * - Real-time clustering where performance is critical
 * - Use cases where a simple, predictable grid structure is sufficient
 *
 * Slower for:
 * - Highly dynamic data that requires adaptive cluster sizes
 * - Scenarios where varying density should influence cluster sizes (e.g., DBSCAN-like approaches)
 * - Irregularly shaped clusters that do not fit a strict grid pattern
